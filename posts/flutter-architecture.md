# Introduction

In this blog post i want to share with you some thoughts on architecting
enterprise level Flutter based mobile application

# Motivation

i want cross-platform rss-reader

# Why Flutter ? 

[Flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/resources/architectural-overview) 
is a framework for building cross-platform mobile applications. 
The framework is built using the 
[Dart](https://dart.dev/overview)
language. 

# Targeting multiple platforms

flutter is cross-platform but is not platform adaptive, 
it is compiled to machine code, but this still
does not mean that apps built with flutter can not 
be considered as native apps. 

what does native mean ?

# Conclusion

I feel like the whole idea of architecting enterprise level 
applications are taken to the extreme.
we should appreciate the simplicity instead of aiming for more complex systems
