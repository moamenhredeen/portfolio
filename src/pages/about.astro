        Let me introduce myself. I’m an enthusiastic software developer,
        currently living and working in Germany. I have a deep love for
        tinkering with weird software ideas and diving headfirst into
        challenging technical problems—there’s something exciting about breaking
        things just to figure out how they work. I was born in 1997 in Tafas, a
        small town in southern Syria. In 2015, when the war broke out, I left my
        home and moved to Germany as a refugee. Starting over wasn’t easy, but I
        took it step by step—learning the language, adapting to a new culture,
        and eventually studying computer science. That journey led me to where I
        am today, doing what I love and continuously pushing myself to learn and
        grow. You can find me at
