<h1 class="text-7xl text-zinc-600 font-bold">Who am I ?</h1>
<p class="max-w-3xl py-8 text-2xl font-light">
	Let me introduce myself.
	I’m an enthusiastic software developer, currently living and working in Germany.
	I have a deep love for tinkering with weird software ideas and diving headfirst into challenging technical
	problems—there’s something exciting about breaking things just to figure out how they work.
	I was born in 1997 in Tafas, a small town in southern Syria.
	In 2015, when the war broke out, I left my home and moved to Germany as a refugee.
	Starting over wasn’t easy, but I took it step by step—learning the language, adapting to a new culture, and
	eventually studying computer science.
	That journey led me to where I am today, doing what I love and continuously pushing myself to learn and grow.
