# Biography

Biography
I am a passionate software developer who thrives on tackling complex challenges and continuously learning new concepts.
For me, software development isn't just a job—it's what I love to do most. I’m always eager to dive deep into the latest
frameworks, understanding their internals, and pushing my skills to the next level. Routine and repetitive work don’t
excite me; I’m driven by tasks that force me to think critically and innovate. I find joy in refactoring code and am
almost religious about maintaining clean, readable, and efficient code. Whether it's mastering a new technology or
optimizing a system, I'm always ready to take on the next challenge. From fullstack development to embedded systems and
DevOps, my career has been defined by my desire to solve complex problems and continually improve my craft. I’m
dedicated to creating software that is not only functional but also elegant and maintainable, and I’m always looking for
opportunities that allow me to grow as a developer

# Experience


## Software Engineer - Primion Technology GmbH
Jan 2023 - Present

After working on the PSIM platform, I transitioned to the hardware department at Primion to help develop our embedded
software platform. In this role, I contributed to building a YAWL-based workflow management system for our devices. This
shift allowed me to apply my software development skills to embedded systems, further broadening my expertise in
integrating complex workflows into hardware solutions

**Earned skills**: Software Architecture, Java, Gradle, Distributed Systems, MQTT, Workflow Engines, Workflow Management
Systems

## Software Engineer | Primion Technology GmbH
Jan 2022 - Jan 2023

After completing my thesis, I joined Primion full-time and worked on their PSIM (Physical Security Information
Management) platform. Initially, I focused on the mobile client, but soon transitioned to backend development, primarily
using Spring. Later, I contributed to integrating OPC UA into our PSIM platform, enhancing its capabilities. Toward the
end of my time there, I shifted into a DevOps role, where I modernized the build process for Java and .NET projects. I
wrote custom Maven plugins and MSBuild tasks to automate common tasks, streamlining our development workflow

**Earned skills**: Software Architecture, Java, Jakarta EE, Spring, Hibernate, (formally known as J2EE), JavaFX, .NET Core,
Maven, MSBuild, DevOps, Apache Cordova


## Thesis | Primion Technology GmbH
Apr 2021 - Oct 2021

For my thesis at Primion, I focused on interprocess communication for a new software platform that would run on access
controllers, which manage access points. My research involved comparing different architectural patterns, including
multi-threading, RPC, and MQTT, to identify the most suitable approach for the platform. I also explored the benefits of
using Docker for embedded software, with our system running on Yocto Linux. This project deepened my understanding of
system architecture and the unique challenges of developing software for embedded systems in access control
environments.

**Earned skills**: Software Architecture, Distributed Systems, MQTT, Java, C++

## Intern | Primion Technology GmbH
Nov 2020 - Apr 2021

During my Praxis semester, I interned as a Java Developer at Primion. My main responsibility was migrating the company's
in-house bug tracker to Jira Cloud. To make this process efficient, I developed a Java tool that automatically
transferred all our projects and users to Jira Cloud using their REST API. This experience gave me hands-on knowledge of
software migration and improved my skills in Java and working with APIs.

**Earned skills**: Java, REST APIs, Linux Containers (Docker)

## Fullstack Web Developer | Vinnova
Jan 2024 - Jun 2024

While studying, I worked part-time as a Fullstack Web Developer at Vennova. I helped build software that made tunnel
inspections in Sweden more efficient by analyzing 3D models of tunnels to find cracks in the support structure. I worked
on both the frontend and backend, using React and Node.js to create a user-friendly interface and ensure smooth
performance. Although I didn’t work directly with the machine learning side of things, I collaborated with the team to
make sure everything came together

**Earned skills**: NodeJs, Express.js, REST APIs, ReactJs
