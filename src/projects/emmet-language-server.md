I'm currently learning Rust and as you all now the best to learn a language, is
to build something with it. I did not want to start building something complex,
because this can prevent me from focusing on the rust language it self. For this
reason i choose to build a language server for emmet.

# Background

# Emmet

from their site

> Emmet is a plug in for many popular text editors which greatly improves HTML &
> CSS workflow
>
> -- [emmet.io](https://emmet.io) 

emmet works like code snippets for HTML and CSS, but it is way more powerfull
than traditional code snippets.

# Language Server

A Language Server is a server designed to provide language-specific features
such as auto-completion, error-checking, and code formatting to code editors and
Integrated Development Environments (IDEs).

The concept of a Language Server is based on the LSP[] [Language Server Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/) (LSP), which was originally developed by Microsoft.
