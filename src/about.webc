        <p>
            Let me introduce myself. I‚Äôm an enthusiastic software developer, currently living and working in Germany. I
            have
            a deep love for tinkering with weird software ideas and diving headfirst into challenging technical
            problems‚Äîthere‚Äôs something exciting about breaking things just to figure out how they work.

            I was born in 1997 in Tafas, a small town in southern Syria. In 2015, when the war broke out, I left my home
            and
            moved to Germany as a refugee. Starting over wasn‚Äôt easy, but I took it step by step‚Äîlearning the language,
            adapting to a new culture, and eventually studying computer science. That journey led me to where I am
            today,
            doing what I love and continuously pushing myself to learn and grow.

        <strong>And that‚Äôs pretty much me! Thanks  for stopping by. üñêÔ∏è</strong>
